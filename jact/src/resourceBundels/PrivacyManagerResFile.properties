resStr_PrivacyManagerDesc=If no Caller*ID is sent, PrivacyManager answers the channel and asks the caller to enter their phone number. The caller is given 3 attempts. If after 3 attempts, they do not enter at least a 10 digit phone number, and if there exists a priority n + 101, where 'n' is the priority of the current instance, then the channel will be setup to continue at that priority level. Otherwise, it returns 0. Does nothing if Caller*ID was received on the channel.  Configuration file privacy.conf contains two variables:  maxretries default 3 -maximum number of attempts the caller is allowed to input a callerid.  minlength default 10 -minimum allowable digits in the input callerid number.
