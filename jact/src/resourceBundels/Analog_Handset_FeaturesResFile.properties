res_stradsi=adsi
res_stradsiDescription= If your handset has ADSI (Analog Display Services Interface) capability, set set adsi=yes. The ADSI specification is system similar to Caller ID to pass encoded information to an analog handset. It allows the creation of interactive visual menus on a multiline display, offering access to services such as voicemail through a text interface.
res_stradsiDisplayName= adsi
res_strimmediate=immediate
res_strimmediateDescription= Normally (i.e. with immediate set to 'no', the default), when you lift an FXS handset, the Zaptel driver provides you a dialtone and listens for digits that you dial, passing them on to Asterisk. Asterisk waits until the number you've dialed matches an extension, and then begins executing the first command on the matching extension. If you set immediate=yes, then Asterisk will instruct the Zaptel driver to not generate a dialtone when you lift a handset, instead passing control immediately to Asterisk. Asterisk will start executing the commands for this channel's "s" extension. This is sometimes referred to as "batphone mode". Default no.    immediate=yes
res_strimmediateDisplayName= immediate
res_strcallwaiting=callwaiting
res_strcallwaitingDescription= If enabled, Asterisk will generate "call waiting pips" when you are already in a conversation on your FXS handset when someone tries to call you. If the channel has call waiting by default, you can temporarily disable it by lifting the handset and dialing *70, whereupon you will get a dialrecall tone and may then dial the intended number. There is no corresponding way to temporarily enable call waiting for channels that have it off by default. Default no.    callwaiting=yes
res_strcallwaitingDisplayName= callwaiting
res_strcallwaitingcallerid=callwaitingcallerid
res_strcallwaitingcalleridDescription= Sets whether Asterisk will send Caller ID data to the handset during call waiting indication. Requires also setting callwaiting=yes. Default no.    callwaitingcallerid=yes
res_strcallwaitingcalleridDisplayName= callwaitingcallerid
res_strthreewaycalling=threewaycalling
res_strthreewaycallingDescription= If enabled, you can place a call on hold by pressing a hook flash, whereupon you get a dialrecall tone and can make another call. Default no.    threewaycalling=yes
res_strthreewaycallingDisplayName= threewaycalling
res_strtransfer=transfer
res_strtransferDescription= This option has effect only when threewaycalling=yes. If threewaycalling=yes and transfer=yes, then once you've placed a call on hold with a hook flash, you can transfer that call to another extension by dialing the extension and hanging up. Default no.    transfer=yes
res_strtransferDisplayName= transfer
res_strcancallforward=cancallforward
res_strcancallforwardDescription= If enabled, you may activate "call forwarding immediate" by dialing *72 (whereupon you get a dialrecall tone) followed by the extension number you wish to forward your calls to. If someone dials your extension, the call will be redirected to the forwarding number. You may disable the call forwarding by dialing *73. Default no.    cancallforward=yes
res_strcancallforwardDisplayName= cancallforward
res_strcallreturn=callreturn
res_strcallreturnDescription= If enabled, you may dial *69 to have Asterisk read to you the caller ID of the last person to call. You will hear the dialrecall tone if there is no record of a last caller. Default no.    callreturn=yes
res_strcallreturnDisplayName= callreturn
res_strcallgroup=callgroup
res_strcallgroupDescription= A channel may belong to zero or more callgroups. Callgroups specify who may answer this phone when it is ringing. If this channel is ringing, then any other channel whose pickupgroups include one of this channel's callgroups may answer the call by dialing *8#. This feature is supported by Zap, SIP, Skinny and MGCP channels. Group numbers can range from 0 to 31. The default value is an empty string, i.e. no groups.   group=1   callgroup=1,2,3
res_strcallgroupDisplayName= callgroup
res_strpickupgroup=pickupgroup
res_strpickupgroupDescription= A channel may belong to zero or more pickupgroups. Pickupgroups specify whose phones you may answer. If another channel is ringing, and this channel's pickupgroups include one of the ringing channel's callgroups, then this channel may answer the call by dialing *8#. Group numbers can range from 0 to 31. The default value is an empty string, i.e. no groups.
res_strpickupgroupDisplayName= pickupgroup
res_struseincomingcalleridonzaptransfer=useincomingcalleridonzaptransfer
res_struseincomingcalleridonzaptransferDescription= If you set this option (Use Incoming Caller ID On Zap Transfer) to 'yes', then when you transfer a call to another phone, the original caller's Caller ID will get forwarded on too. Default no.    useincomingcalleridonzaptransfer=yes
res_struseincomingcalleridonzaptransferDisplayName= useincomingcalleridonzaptransfer
