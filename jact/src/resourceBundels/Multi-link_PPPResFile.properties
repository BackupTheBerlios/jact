resStr_Multi-link_PPP=Multi-link_PPP
resStr_Multi-link_PPPDesc=If you have an ISDN PRI, you may be able to run multi-link PPP over it, to provide you with a data connection. Multi-link PPP is a technology that allows channels on a PRI to be dynamically allocated between voice and data. Asterisk can take voice channels allocated to it, dial a Remote Access Server, and dump the channels into a special extension that delivers the channel to the zaptel data layer. Configure the settings here, and then see the ZapRAS command to make it happen. PRI channels can have an idle extension and a minunused number. So long as at least minunused channels are idle, the Zap channel module will try to dial idledial on them, and then Asterisk will begin executing the commands for the context and extension specified by idleext. When channels are needed for voice calls, the "idle" calls are disconnected (so long as there are at least minidle calls still running, of course) to make more channels available. The primary use of this is to create a dynamic service, where idle channels are bundled through multilink PPP, thus more efficiently utilizing combined voice/data services than conventional fixed mappings/muxings.

res_strMinunused=Minunused
res_strMinunusedDescription= The minimum number of unused channels available. If there are fewer channels available, Asterisk will not attempt to bundle any channels and give them to the data connection. Takes an integer.
res_strMinunusedDisplayName= Minunused
res_strMinidle=Minidle
res_strMinidleDescription= The minimum number of idle channels to bundle for the data link. Asterisk will keep this number of channels open for data, rather than taking them back for voice channels when needed. Takes an integer.
res_strMinidleDisplayName= Minidle
res_strIdledial=Idledial
res_strIdledialDescription= The number to dial as the idle number. This is typically the number to dial a Remote Access Server (RAS). Channels being idled for data will be sent to this extension. Takes an integer that does not conflict with any other extension in the Dialplan, and has been defined as an idleext.
res_strIdledialDisplayName= Idledial
res_strIdleext=Idleext
res_strIdleextDescription= The extension to use as the idle extension. Takes a value in the form of exten@context. Typically, the extension would be an extension to run the ZapRAS command.
res_strIdleextDisplayName= Idleext
