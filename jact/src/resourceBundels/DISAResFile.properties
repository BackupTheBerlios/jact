
resStr_DISA=DISA
resStr_DISADesc=-- Allows someone from outside the telephone switch (PBX) to obtain an "internal" system dialtone and to place calls from it as if they were placing a call from within the switch. A user calls a number that connects to the DISA application and is given dialtone. The user enters their passcode, followed by the pound sign (#). If the passcode is correct, the user is then given system dialtone on which a call may be placed. Obviously, this type of access has SERIOUS security implications, and GREAT care must be taken NOT to compromise your security.  There is a possibility of accessing DISA without password. Simply exchange your password with no-password.   Example: exten => s,1,DISA,no-password|local  but be aware of using this for your security compromising.  The arguments to this application (in extensions.conf) allow either specification of a single global password (that everyone uses), or individual passwords contained in a file. It also allow specification of the context on which the user will be dialing. If no context is specified, the DISA application defaults the context to "disa" presumably that a normal system will have a special context set up for DISA use with some or a lot of restrictions. The arguments are one of the following:   numeric-passcode  numeric-passcode|context  full-pathname-of-file-that-contains-passcodes  The file that contains the passcodes (if used) allows specification of either just a passcode (defaulting to the "disa" context, or passcode|context on each line of the file. The file may contain blank lines, or comments starting with "#" or ";". In addition, the above arguments may have |new-callerid-string appended to them, to specify a new (different) callerid to be used for this call, for example: numeric-passcode|context|"My Phone" <(234) 123-4567> or  full-pathname-of-passcode-file|"My Phone" <(234) 123-4567>. Last but not least, |mailbox[@context] may be appended, which will cause a stutter-dialtone (indication "dialrecall") to be used, if the specified mailbox contains any new messages, for example: numeric-passcode|context||1234 (w/a changing callerid). Note that in the case of specifying the numeric-passcode, the context must be specified if the callerid is specified also.  If login is successful, the application parses the dialed number in the specified (or default) context, and returns 0 with the new extension context filled-in and the priority set to 1, so that the PBX may re-apply the routing tables to it and complete the call normally.
