 <h4>If you have an ISDN PRI, you may be able to run multi-link PPP over it, to provide you with a data connection. Multi-link PPP is a technology that allows channels on a PRI to be dynamically allocated between voice and data. Asterisk can take voice channels allocated to it, dial a Remote Access Server, and dump the channels into a special extension that delivers the channel to the zaptel data layer. Configure the settings here, and then see the ZapRAS command to make it happen. PRI channels can have an idle extension and a minunused number. So long as at least minunused channels are idle, the Zap channel module will try to dial idledial on them, and then Asterisk will begin executing the commands for the context and extension specified by idleext. When channels are needed for voice calls, the "idle" calls are disconnected (so long as there are at least minidle calls still running, of course) to make more channels available. The primary use of this is to create a dynamic service, where idle channels are bundled through multilink PPP, thus more efficiently utilizing combined voice/data services than conventional fixed mappings/muxings.</h4></td>
