are controlled at compile-time.  The new jitterbuffer additionally has support for PLC

which greatly improves quality as the jitterbuffer adapts size, and in compensating for lost packets. All the jitter buffer settings except dropcount are in milliseconds.

 <h4> Further user sections may be added, specifying a context and a secret used for connections with that given authentication name. Limited IP based access control is allowed by use of "allow" and "deny" keywords.  Multiple rules are permitted.  Multiple permitted contexts may be specified, in which case the first will be the default. You can also override caller*ID so that when you receive a call you set the Caller*ID to be what you want instead of trusting what the remote user provides There are three authentication methods that are supported:  md5, plaintext, and rsa.  The least secure is "plaintext", which sends passwords cleartext across the net.  "md5" uses a challenge/response md5 sum arrangement, but still requires both ends have plain text access to the secret.  "rsa" allows unidirectional secret knowledge through public/private keys.  If "rsa" authentication is used, "inkeys" is a list of acceptable public keys on the  local system that can be used to authenticate the remote peer, separated by the ":" character.  "outkey" is a single, private key to use to authenticate to the other side.  Public keys are named /var/lib/asterisk/keys/<name>.pub while private keys are named /var/lib/asterisk/keys/<name>.key.  Private keys should always be 3DES encrypted.</h4></td>
